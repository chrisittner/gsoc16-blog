title: GSoC proposal accepted!
date: 26.04.16

My proposal for [Google Summer of Code 2016](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) has been accepted, despite initial worries. This means that I will spend part of this summer working on the  [pgmpy](http://pgmpy.org) library. I will implement some techniques for Bayesian Network structure learning.

As a first step, I set up this blog to document my progress. It is built with the [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/) static-site generator and hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Updates will follow!
